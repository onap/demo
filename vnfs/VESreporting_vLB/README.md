PROJECT DESCRIPTION
---
This project contains the source code and scripts for the periodic generation of network measurement reports. The folder contains:

 - README.md: this file.

 - LICENSE.TXT: the license text.

 - vpp_measurement_reporter.c: source code that uses the ECOMP Vendor Event Listener Library (VES) to read metrics from the network interface and send periodic measurement reports to the VES collector in DCAE. The VES library used here has been cloned from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/att/evel-library on February 1, 2017.

 - Makefile: makefile that compiles vpp_measurement_reporter.c and generates vpp_measurement_reporter binary.

 - go-client.sh: bash script that starts up the vpp_measurement_reporter binary generated by Makefile. It reads input parameters like DCAE IP address and port from configuration files contained in /opt/config.


USAGE
---
To run the vpp_measurement_reporter, please execute the following steps:

 - Make the go-client.sh script executable
        chmod +x go-client.sh

 - Run the go-client.sh script
