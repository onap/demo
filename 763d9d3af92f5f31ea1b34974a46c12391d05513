      "message": "DCAEgen2 is not supposed to talk to the proxied openstack while MultiCloud federates 2 OpenStack instance into single one. This design is to make the federation invisible to DCAEgen2. (The only trick thing is that DCAEgen2 has to input the parameters and registration 2 openstack instance to make the federation happen, but that should be the only place that DCAEgen2 knows something about the proxied openstack, and that part might be encapsulated/moved to other place in future",
